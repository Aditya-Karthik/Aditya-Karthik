My research focuses on developing high-order finite element schemes for efficient non-hydrostatic ocean modeling. I develop C++ and Python code to carry out large-scale simulations of ocean dynamics on high-performance architecture frameworks. I am currently looking for Summer 2025 internship opportunities.
